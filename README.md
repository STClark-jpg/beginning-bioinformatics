# Bioinformatics Rosalind Solution - Module 03

## Project Overview
This repository contains solutions for **Rosalind bioinformatics problems (1-9)** as part of Module 03 in BIOL 5340. The project demonstrates Python fundamentals (loops, conditionals, file I/0, dictionaries, etc.) applied to bioinformatics problems such as DNA/RNA sequence manipulation, transcription, translation, and GC content calculation. 

Key Features:
- Well-documented Colab notebook with step-by-step solutions.
- AI usage log ('docs/ai.usage.md') for transparency on where AI was used for checking code.
- Structured repository for reproducibility and clarity.
